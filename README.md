Elevator action – Double trouble
### Outline supported by Aims and Objectives
The outline of the game is a reboot of the 1983 arcade game “Elevator Action”. The aim of the reboot is to recreate the game with multiplayer co-op and Vs gameplay. The main objectives of the project are to recreate the game with close to similar physics, gameplay and style. The other objective is to create the game with a co-op feature including the single player game mode. This will be the unique selling point of the reboot.
### Overall Management Strategy (explanation and justification)
The way that this game development will be managed will be through a schedule/timetable that will allow me to make the most out of my time developing the game and get it done on time. The timetable will have the number of hours that will be spent into creating the game each day.
### Requirements (resources, tools, techniques, development environment, costs, risks, quality assurance, etc.)
There will be many requirements for this project one of these requirements will be the tools that are used during the project. These include the computers that are used as well as the software used as well. An example of the software used would be Photoshop, Unity etc. Another requirement would be the cost of the development of this project. The cost will be small with the only payment being the maintenance of the computer and the software. Quality assurance is a requirement because the final product will need to be tested so that I meats the aims from the start.
### General Plan (in the form of a narrative)
### Research plan (where, what, how, why)
### Overall GANTT Chart
### Target User, User Requirements & Expectations
The target audience would be anyone 12+. This is because the video game will contain violence but on a mild level which is suitable according to the ESRD rating system for ages 12 and above. The User requirements for playing this game will be minimal understanding of how games control (up arrow for up down arrow for down etc). The look of the game will be simplistic with menu navigation being controlled by selecting the menu option with the arrow keys/joystick.
