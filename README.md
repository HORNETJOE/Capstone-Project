# Capstone-Project

## Elevator action â€“ Double trouble
Outline supported by Aims and Objectives

## Overall Management Strategy (explanation and justification)
The way that this game development will be managed will be through a schedule/timetable that will allow me to make the most out of my time developing the game and get it done on time. The timetable will have the number of hours that will be spent into creating the game each day.
## Requirements (resources, tools, techniques, development environment, costs, risks, quality assurance, etc.)
## General Plan (in the form of a narrative)
## Research plan (where, what, how, why)
## Overall GANTT Chart
## Target User, User Requirements & Expectations
The target audience would be anyone 12+. This is because the video game will contain violence but on a mild level which is suitable according to the ESRD rating system for ages 12 and above. The User requirements for playing this game will be minimal understanding of how games control (up arrow for up down arrow for down etc). The look of the game will be simplistic with menu navigation being controlled by selecting the menu option with the arrow keys/joystick.
## Project Milestones (Consider these to be EPICS)

## User Stories (Project Backlog)
